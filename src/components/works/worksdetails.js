    description: `InnovateHER KC, a nonprofit in Kansas City, MO committed to supporting all womxn, promoting diversity, and advancing its member’s professional goals—came to Prime Digital Academy with a challenge.
      Their online presence began on Facebook and has grown to 3,000+ members. As the community has grown, so have its needs. For example, while the group was smaller and the FB Page had less activity, sifting through previous posts for like-minded people and resources wasn’t as inconvenient as it is now. Today, the page is so active that finding a post from an hour ago is a challenge.
      In summary, the ask was to conveniently organize InnovateHER’s resources for member’s easy access and provide a more targeted way of connecting with similar and/or complementary individuals.
      Out of this request, ConnectHER, a social networking application tailored to InnovateHER, emerged. It promotes inclusive interaction while also aligning specific members based on similarities, gathers analytics in a straightforward manner allowing newfound knowledge to better the user experience, and ultimately, makes community resources more easily accessible.`,
